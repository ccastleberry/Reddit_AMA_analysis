# Reddit_AMA_analysis

## Project for teamup inspired by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/)

## Let's explore data from [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/)

### Very rough plan:
- we will fetch data (posts and questions ) from 100 the most popular(upvotes) questions
- create a database or a file from it
- analyze the data however we want (extract who was the interviewed person, find out most common words in questions, upvotes, index of friendly/hostile words related to certain AMA, and whatever comes to your minds)
- visualize whatever we find interesting


### What we want to practice:
- data aquisition with API
- GitHub collaboration
- data analysis
- data visualisation
